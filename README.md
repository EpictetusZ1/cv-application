# CV (Resume) Application

### Submit your resume data to a website using this handy tool ! 

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn and practice:
- React Basics
- React Class Components (Entire app is built using class components)
- State and Props
- Passing State as a Prop
- Thinking the 'React' way

### Things I learned:
- Using ```map()``` with React, and the importance of having unique 'keys' for values
- The importance and benefit of Non-mutating methods in my applications
- Single source of truth for input handling and React components
- Unidirectional Data-flow
- CSS Modules and using the ```styles.class``` syntax for adding ```className={}```
- Index as a key Anti-Pattern (To be used with a high degree of discretion)
- Ternary Operator ```condition ? expIfTrue : expIfFalse```
- Short Circuit Operator ``` condition && expressionIfTrue```
- Destructuring props
- Event Handling in React with Synthetic Event handlers: ```onClick={}, onSubmit={}, etc...```
- The importance of callbacks if you are calling a function that relies on state, and that state has just been altered

### Functionality:
- Add individual components to a 'Resume / CV' which is rendered in HTML
- Edit the state of each item after it has been 'Posted or Submitted'
- Edit the individual state of items that can have an unlimited number of siblings - such as the "Work" section. This is done using the items unique "Key"

#### Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS
- React.js
- CSS Modules
- Webpack
- Create React App - An npm tool: ```npm create-react-app```
- ESLint
